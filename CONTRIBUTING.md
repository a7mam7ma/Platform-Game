## Tips 
* If you're working on an open issue, place a comment on it so others know it's in progress.
* Use the issue description you're working on for your commit message, e.g. "Issue #10 Updated README.md".
* If you're **not** working on one of the existing issues, remember to *create a new one* before you submit a pull request.
* If another contributor has commented on an issue, this usually means they're working on it. Have a look at the comments before you begin working.
* Before you create a new pull request, test your changes to ensure they work correctly. Try playing the game a few times in different browsers, e.g. Chrome/Firefox/Opera/Safari.
